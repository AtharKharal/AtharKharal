# Technical Writer | DocOps Engineer | Documentation Specialist

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’m a Technical Writer and Documentation Engineer with a PhD in Mathematics and a strong foundation in data-driven programming, version-controlled documentation, and docs-as-code infrastructure. I specialize in transforming complex technical domains into clear, actionable, and version-aware documentation using tools like **AsciiDoc**, **Antora**, **Git**, **LaTeX**, and **Markdown**.

## 🔍 Work Focus

My work centers on building **multi-repo, multi-version documentation sites** using Antora. These sites replicate real-world enterprise documentation ecosystems such as Red Hat OpenShift. The objective is to model modular documentation workflows that are CI/CD-ready, Git-native, and easily scalable.

I am actively exploring:

- Component-based technical documentation in distributed repositories
- GitHub Actions and CI pipelines for doc automation
- Developer-oriented authoring environments using VS Code, YAML, and scripting
- Integrating AsciiDoc with scientific writing (LaTeX, R, Markdown)

## 📂 Featured Repositories

### [`openshift-docs-site`](https://github.com/AtharKharal/openshift-docs-site)
> A full-scale Antora documentation site built locally with three component repositories (`ocp-security-docs`, `ocp-networking-docs`, `openshift-docs`). Demonstrates multi-version support, Git-based content sourcing, and UI customization.

### [`asciidoc-playground`](https://github.com/AtharKharal/asciidoc-playground)
> A curated set of AsciiDoc experiments with exhaustive commenting. Useful for LaTeX authors transitioning to semantic, Git-native documentation workflows.

### [`docops-snippets`](https://github.com/AtharKharal/docops-snippets)
> A working collection of GitHub Actions for documentation pipelines, bash utilities, YAML recipes, and Antora automation.

## 🎓 Background

Before transitioning into the technical documentation domain, I served in the **Pakistan Air Force** (retired July 2020), where I worked closely with aerospace engineers, managed aviation records, and served as a registrar with deep involvement in documentation, audit compliance, and ISO 9001 systems. I bring with me a rigorous documentation ethos rooted in precision, traceability, and domain fluency.

## 🌍 Availability

I am open to **remote**, **on-site**, or **contract-based** documentation roles in:

- Europe (Finland, Germany, Netherlands)
- North America (USA, Canada)
- Global remote-first teams

If you're seeking a technically fluent writer who understands developer workflows, Git ecosystems, and scalable documentation architectures—let’s connect.
